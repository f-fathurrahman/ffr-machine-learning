Some important aspects of data science:
\begin{itemize}
\item structuring data
\item visualizing data
\item mathematical analysis of data (the main challenge)
\end{itemize}

When the goal is to interpret the model and quantify the uncertainty in the data,
this analysis is usually referred to as \emph{statistical learning}.

When the emphasis in on making predictions using large-scale data, the it is common
to speak about machine learning or data mining.

Two major goals for modeling data:
\begin{itemize}
\item to accurately predict some future quantity of interest
\item to discover unusual or interesting patterns in the data
\end{itemize}

To achieve these goals, one must rely on knowledge from three important pillars
of the mathematical sciences:
\begin{itemize}
\item Function approximation
\item Optimization
\item Probability and statistics
\end{itemize}


\section{Supervised and unsupervised learning}

Given an input or feature vector $\mathbf{x}$, predict an output or \emph{response} variable $y$.

The prediction is encoded in a mathematical function $g$, called the prediction function,
which takes an input $\mathbf{x}$ and outputs a guess $g(\mathbf{x})$ for $y$, denoted by
$\widehat{y}$.
